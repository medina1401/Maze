# SimpleMazeSolver Documentation

## Description
The `SimpleMazeSolver` class generates a random maze and solves it using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
The maze is represented as a 2D character grid where each cell is either a wall, an open path, the start point, the exit point, or a visited point. 

### Key Symbols:
- **WALL (`#`)**: Represents the maze's walls.
- **PATH (` `)**: Represents the open spaces in the maze.
- **START (`S`)**: The starting point in the maze.
- **EXIT (`E`)**: The exit point of the maze.
- **VISITED (`.`)**: Marks cells that have been visited during the solving process.

The program consists of four main functions:
1. **`createMaze()`**: Initializes the maze with walls.
2. **`generateMaze(int x, int y)`**: Recursively generates the maze by carving paths from the given coordinates.
3. **`solveMaze(int x, int y)`**: Solves the maze using DFS, marking the visited cells as `.`.
4. **`printMaze()`**: Prints the maze's current state to the console.

The maze is a rectangular grid of 11x21 cells (rows and columns), ensuring that it is large enough for a reasonable level of complexity. 
The start point is always set at `(1, 1)`, and the exit is at `(ROWS - 2, COLS - 2)`.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. **`createMaze()`**
This method initializes the maze with walls (`#`). The maze is a 2D array where all cells are initially set to `#`.

### 2. **`generateMaze(int x, int y)`**
This function generates the maze recursively. It starts at the coordinates `(x, y)` and creates paths in random directions. 
The four possible directions are up, down, left, and right, and these directions are randomly shuffled to ensure that each maze is unique. The function works by:
- Marking the current cell as a `PATH`.
- Checking each direction for an empty space and recursively carving paths in those directions.

### 3. **`solveMaze(int x, int y)`**
This method solves the maze using a DFS algorithm. The algorithm explores the maze recursively, marking each visited cell with `.`.
It checks if it has reached the exit (`E`) and, if not, it tries to move in all four possible directions until the path is found.

### 4. **`printMaze()`**
This function prints the current state of the maze to the console, displaying the maze grid row by row.

## Possible Issues

### 1. **Maze Generation Problems**
- **Unreachable Exit**: If the maze is not properly generated with a valid path to the exit, there may be no way to reach the exit.
  - **Solution**: Make sure that the maze generation ensures there is always a path from the start to the exit.
  
- **Non-Optimal Path Creation**: Sometimes the DFS-based generation can create very long or overly complicated paths.
  - **Solution**: For a more randomized maze, consider using a more advanced generation algorithm like Prim's or Kruskal's.

### 2. **Recursive Depth in `solveMaze()`**
- **Potential Stack Overflow**: If the maze is very large or complex, the recursive depth may cause a stack overflow.
  - **Solution**: Refactor the DFS algorithm to use an iterative approach, which avoids recursion limits.

### 3. **Maze Visualization**
- **Difficult to Read Output**: For larger mazes, the printed output might become hard to interpret in the console.
  - **Solution**: Improve the readability of the printed maze by adding more space or using a graphical representation.

### 4. **Hardcoded Maze Size**
- The maze size is hardcoded (11x21). This might not be suitable for different maze sizes.
  - **Solution**: Allow for customizable maze sizes through user input or configuration.

### 5. **Fixed Start and Exit Points**
- **Fixed Start and Exit**: The start and exit are fixed at `(1, 1)` and `(ROWS - 2, COLS - 2)` respectively, which may not be ideal for certain maze configurations.
  - **Solution**: Randomize the start and exit points to make the maze generation more dynamic.

## Conclusion
The `SimpleMazeSolver` class is a straightforward implementation of a maze generator and solver. 
While functional, there are several areas where the program could be enhanced, especially in terms of efficiency and usability. 
Improvements could include refining the maze generation process, optimizing the solving algorithm, and adding flexibility to handle different maze sizes or random start/exit points.
